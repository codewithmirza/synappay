# 🚨 SECURITY REMINDER - READ FIRST

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This project is OPEN SOURCE

### 🔒 NEVER include in any file:
- Private keys (Ethereum or Stellar)
- API keys (except in .env which is gitignored)
- Wallet addresses with real funds
- Any sensitive credentials

### ✅ Safe for open source:
- Contract addresses (public anyway)
- Testnet addresses (no real value)
- Code logic and architecture
- Documentation and guides

### 🛡️ Current Status:
- Using testnet wallets only
- All private keys in .env (gitignored)
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Safe for public repository

## 📝 Before any commit:
1. Check no private keys in code
2. Verify .env is gitignored
3. Ensure only testnet addresses used
4. Review all new files for secrets

**This file serves as a constant reminder for all development work.**
